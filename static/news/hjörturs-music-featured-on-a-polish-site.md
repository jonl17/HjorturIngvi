Delighted to be featured and reviewed on this Polish site, which is focused exclusively on Icelandic music. 

"The sound of Hjörtur Jóhannsson's compositions created so far as part of the "24 Pictures" project is the result of the composer's inspiration with classical, neoclassical, film, jazz and improvised music. Instrumental, quite short pieces are characterized by a subtle emotionality, tinged with a hint of reflection. The sonic elegance and intimate atmosphere that the composer is able to bring out from the piano come to the fore in these works."
